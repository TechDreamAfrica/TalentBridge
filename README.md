## Setup Instructions

### 1. Firebase Configuration
1. Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Firestore Database and Storage
3. Copy your Firebase configuration
4. Replace the placeholder config in `script.js`:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "your-api-key",
    authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "your-project-id",
    storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "123456789",
    appId: "your-app-id"
};
```

### 2. Database Structure
The application creates two main collections in Firestore:

**Applications Collection**:
```
applications/
â”œâ”€â”€ firstName: string

â”œâ”€â”€ phone: string

â”œâ”€â”€ subject: string
â”œâ”€â”€ message: string
â”œâ”€â”€ timestamp: timestamp
```

### 3. Storage Rules
Configure Firebase Storage rules for resume uploads:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /resumes/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null || true;
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Firestore Rules
Configure Firestore security rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /applications/{document} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
